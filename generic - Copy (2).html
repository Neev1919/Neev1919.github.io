								<h2>Skills</h2>
								<p>As a prospective computer science student, I bring a diverse set of skills and experiences that will contribute to my success in the field. My leadership abilities have been developed through a formal course and practical experiences, including leading my school's STEM club and volunteering as a leader at a soccer camp. These roles have taught me how to motivate and guide others effectively. Additionally, I have a strong background in public speaking, having delivered annual speeches in Gujarati at my language school for the past 13 years. This long-term commitment has honed my communication skills, enabling me to present ideas clearly and engage with audiences effectively. These experiences showcase my dedication to personal growth and my readiness to contribute positively to collaborative and innovative environments .</p>
								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p>In addition to my academic and leadership pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests that contribute to my well-rounded profile. One of my key interests is basketball, which I have played in house leagues for several years. My dedication and teamwork skills culminated in winning a house league tournament. Swimming is another passion of mine; I have pursued it for over 10 years, achieving the significant milestone of becoming a certified national lifeguard. This accomplishment not only underscores my commitment to the sport but also demonstrates my discipline and focus over an extended period. Furthermore, I have a strong interest in business. I have taken multiple business courses, actively participated in the Flowboat Entrepreneurship Club, and created projects for businesses. These experiences have provided me with valuable insights into the business world and strengthened my problem-solving and entrepreneurial skills.
