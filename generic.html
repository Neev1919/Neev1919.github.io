								<h2>Early Life</h2>
								<p>I was born in the vibrant city of Kitchener, Ontario. Growing up in this diverse and dynamic community, I've spent most of my life immersed in the rich cultural and educational opportunities the city offers.

From a young age, I attended Empire Public School, where I first developed a love for learning and a curiosity about the world around me. It was during these early years that I was introduced to the basics of technology and computers, sparking a fascination that would only grow stronger with time.

As I progressed to Centennial Middle School, my interest in computer science began to take shape. I eagerly participated in school technology clubs and took every opportunity to learn more about coding and problem-solving. My time at Centennial was marked by a commitment to personal growth and a burgeoning passion for the world of computer science, laying a strong foundation for my future endeavors.</p>
								<h2>Current Life</h2>
								<p>I am currently attending Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute, where I am enrolled in the prestigious International Baccalaureate (IB) program. The rigorous academic environment and diverse curriculum of the IB program have allowed me to delve deeper into my passions for math, computer science, and problem-solving.

At Cameron Heights, I am actively involved in various side projects and volunteer roles, furthering my commitment to both academic excellence and social causes. One of my proudest achievements is founding a STEM club at my school. Through this club, I aim to foster a love for science, technology, engineering, and math among my peers, creating a supportive community for students to explore their interests and develop new skills.

These experiences have not only broadened my knowledge and skills but have also strengthened my resolve to make a positive impact on my community.</p>
